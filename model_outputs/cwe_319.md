## 🔒 Detected Issues and Fixes

### 1. Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Problem**: The code uses HTTP for communication, which transmits data in cleartext. This can expose sensitive information to eavesdropping attacks. It is recommended to use HTTPS to ensure data is encrypted during transmission.

**Vulnerable Code**: 
```python
conn = http.client.HTTPConnection(parsed_url.netloc)
```
**Root Cause**: The code uses HTTP for communication, which transmits data in cleartext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks.
**Consequence**: Sensitive information can be intercepted by attackers if transmitted over HTTP, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access.

**🔧 Suggested Fix:**
```python
conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection(parsed_url.netloc)
```
**Why This Works**: By using HTTPS instead of HTTP, the data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted, protecting it from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This change ensures that sensitive information is securely transmitted over the network.
