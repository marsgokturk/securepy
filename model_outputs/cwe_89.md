# üîç Secure Code Agent Report

## üß™ Verdict
‚ùå The code contains **2 security issue(s)** that need to be addressed.

## üîí Detected Issues and Fixes

### 1. SQL Injection (CWE-89)
**Problem**: The code constructs an SQL query by directly embedding user input into the query string. This approach is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the input to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This can lead to unauthorized data access or modification.

**Vulnerable Code**: 
```python
    query = f"""
        SELECT * FROM inventory 
        WHERE user_id = '{user_id}' AND item_name = '{item_name}'
    """
```
**Root Cause**: The root cause of the vulnerability is the direct embedding of user input into the SQL query string without any sanitization or parameterization.
**Consequence**: If not fixed, this vulnerability can allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, data modification, or even data deletion.

**üîß Suggested Fix:**
```python
    query = "SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE user_id = ? AND item_name = ?"
    cursor.execute(query, (user_id, item_name))
```
**Why This Works**: The suggested code uses parameterized queries, which separate SQL code from data. This prevents user input from being interpreted as SQL code, thus mitigating the risk of SQL injection. By using placeholders ('?') and passing the user input as a tuple to the 'execute' method, the database engine safely handles the input, ensuring it is treated as data rather than executable code.

### 2. Debug Mode Enabled in Production (CWE-94)
**Problem**: The Flask application is running with debug mode enabled. This can expose sensitive information and provide an interactive debugger that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Vulnerable Code**: 
```python
    app.run(debug=True)
```
**Root Cause**: The root cause is the use of 'debug=True' in the Flask app's run configuration, which is intended for development environments only.
**Consequence**: If not fixed, running the application in debug mode in a production environment can expose sensitive information and allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**üîß Suggested Fix:**
```python
    app.run(debug=False)
```
**Why This Works**: The suggested code sets 'debug=False', which disables the interactive debugger and prevents the exposure of sensitive information in production environments. This change ensures that the application runs securely by not providing attackers with additional tools to exploit potential vulnerabilities.
