# üîç Secure Code Agent Report

## üß™ Verdict
‚ùå The code contains **2 security issue(s)** that need to be addressed.

---

## üîí Detected Issues and Fixes

### 1. SQL Injection (CWE-89)
**Problem**: The code constructs an SQL query by directly interpolating user input (public_ip) into the SQL string. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL command by injecting malicious SQL code, leading to unauthorized data access or modification.

**Vulnerable Code**: 
```python
sql = f"UPDATE EC2ServerPublicIP SET publicIP = '{public_ip}' WHERE ID = 1"
```
**Root Cause**: User input is directly interpolated into the SQL string using string formatting, which does not sanitize the input.
**Consequence**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data loss, corruption, or unauthorized access.

**üîß Suggested Fix:**
```python
sql = "UPDATE EC2ServerPublicIP SET publicIP = %s WHERE ID = 1"; cursor.execute(sql, (public_ip,))
```
**Why This Works**: Using parameterized queries with placeholders (e.g., %s) ensures that user input is treated as data rather than executable code. This prevents SQL injection attacks by properly escaping any special characters in the input.

### 2. Use of Hard-Coded Credentials (CWE-798)
**Problem**: The database connection uses hard-coded credentials (username and password). This practice poses a security risk as it can lead to unauthorized access if the source code is exposed. Credentials should be stored securely and not hard-coded in the source code.

**Vulnerable Code**: 
```python
user='admin', password='admin123'
```
**Root Cause**: Hard-coded credentials are embedded directly in the source code, making them easily accessible if the code is exposed.
**Consequence**: If the source code is leaked or accessed by unauthorized individuals, they can gain access to the database using the hard-coded credentials, leading to potential data breaches.

**üîß Suggested Fix:**
```python
import os; user = os.getenv('DB_USER'); password = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
```
**Why This Works**: By using environment variables to store sensitive information like database credentials, the code avoids exposing these credentials in the source code. This practice enhances security by allowing credentials to be managed separately from the application code.
