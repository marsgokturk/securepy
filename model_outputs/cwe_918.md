# üîç Secure Code Agent Report

## üß™ Verdict
‚ùå The code contains **2 security issue(s)** that need to be addressed.

---

## üîí Detected Issues and Fixes

### 1. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Problem**: The code fetches a URL based on user input without validating or restricting the target. This can be exploited to make requests to internal services or other unintended destinations, potentially leading to data exposure or other security issues.

**Vulnerable Code**: 
```python
response = requests.get(target_url, timeout=3)
```
**Root Cause**: The application directly uses user input to construct a URL for a request without any validation or restriction, which is a known pattern for SSRF vulnerabilities.
**Consequence**: An attacker could exploit this to make requests to internal services or other unintended destinations, potentially leading to data exposure or other security issues.

**üîß Suggested Fix:**
```python
import re

ALLOWED_DOMAINS = ["example.com", "another-trusted-site.com"]

@app.route("/fetch")
def fetch_url():
    target_url = request.args.get("url")
    if not target_url:
        return "Missing URL parameter", 400

    # Validate the URL
    if not re.match(r'^https?://', target_url):
        return "Invalid URL format", 400

    # Extract domain and check if it's allowed
    domain = target_url.split('/')[2]
    if domain not in ALLOWED_DOMAINS:
        return "Domain not allowed", 403

    try:
        response = requests.get(target_url, timeout=3)
        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {e}", 500
```
**Why This Works**: The suggested code introduces a validation step to ensure that the URL is in a valid format and restricts requests to a predefined list of allowed domains. This mitigates the SSRF vulnerability by preventing the application from making requests to unauthorized or potentially harmful destinations.
**Further Reading**:  CWE-918

### 2. Debug Mode Enabled in Production
**Problem**: Running Flask with debug=True in production exposes the application to security risks, such as the interactive debugger, which can allow code execution if accessed by an attacker.

**Vulnerable Code**: 
```python
app.run(debug=True)
```
**Root Cause**: The Flask application is configured to run with debug=True, which is intended for development environments and exposes sensitive debugging information.
**Consequence**: If accessed by an attacker, the interactive debugger can allow code execution, leading to potential compromise of the application and server.

**üîß Suggested Fix:**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=False)
```
**Why This Works**: The fix involves setting debug=False when running the Flask application. This ensures that the application does not expose the interactive debugger and other sensitive information in a production environment, mitigating the associated security risks.
