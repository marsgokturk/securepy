## 🔒 Detected Issues and Fixes

### 1. OS Command Injection
**Problem**: The code constructs an OS command string using unsanitized user input (backup_type) and executes it using subprocess.run with shell=True. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, leading to potential system compromise.

**Vulnerable Code**: 
```python
command = f"/path/to/backup_script.sh {backup_type}"
```
**Root Cause**: The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of unsanitized user input to construct a shell command, which is then executed with shell=True. This allows for potential command injection if the input is not properly validated or sanitized.
**Consequence**: If not fixed, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to data loss, data corruption, unauthorized access, or complete system compromise.

**🔧 Suggested Fix:**
```python
command = ["/path/to/backup_script.sh", backup_type]
result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)
```
**Why This Works**: The fix involves using a list to pass the command and its arguments to subprocess.run, which avoids the need for shell=True. This method ensures that the input is treated as a single argument rather than part of a shell command, thus preventing command injection vulnerabilities. By not using shell=True, the input is not interpreted by the shell, which mitigates the risk of injection.
