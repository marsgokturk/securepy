## 🔒 Detected Issues and Fixes

### 1. Inadequate Encryption Strength
**Problem**: The RSA key size used for generating the private key is 1024 bits, which is considered insecure by modern standards. RSA keys should be at least 2048 bits to ensure adequate security against brute-force attacks.

**Vulnerable Code**: 
```python
self.private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(
    public_exponent=65537,
    key_size=1024
)
```
**Root Cause**: The RSA key size is set to 1024 bits, which is below the recommended minimum of 2048 bits for secure encryption.
**Consequence**: Using a 1024-bit RSA key makes the encryption vulnerable to brute-force attacks, potentially allowing attackers to decrypt sensitive information.

**🔧 Suggested Fix:**
```python
self.private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(
    public_exponent=65537,
    key_size=2048
)
```
**Why This Works**: Increasing the RSA key size to 2048 bits enhances the security of the encryption by making it resistant to brute-force attacks. This change aligns with current cryptographic standards and recommendations, ensuring that the encryption strength is adequate to protect sensitive data.
