## üîí Detected Issues and Fixes

### 1. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Problem**: The application fetches content from a URL provided by the user without validating or restricting the target. This can be exploited to make the server perform requests to internal services or other unintended destinations, potentially exposing sensitive information or causing other security issues.

**Vulnerable Code**: 
```python
response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
```
**Root Cause**: The code uses 'requests.get(url, timeout=5)' to fetch content from a user-provided URL without any validation or restriction.
**Consequence**: If not fixed, this vulnerability can be exploited to perform unauthorized requests to internal services, potentially exposing sensitive information or causing other security issues.

**üîß Suggested Fix:**
```python
import re

ALLOWED_DOMAINS = ['example.com', 'another-example.com']


def is_url_allowed(url):
    # Basic check to ensure the URL is within allowed domains
    domain_pattern = re.compile(r'https?://([^/]+)')
    match = domain_pattern.match(url)
    if match:
        domain = match.group(1)
        return any(domain.endswith(allowed_domain) for allowed_domain in ALLOWED_DOMAINS)
    return False


def fetch_url_content(url):
    if not is_url_allowed(url):
        return "URL is not allowed"
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.text
        else:
            return f"Failed to fetch content: {response.status_code}"
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return f"Error occurred: {str(e)}"
```
**Why This Works**: The suggested code introduces a function `is_url_allowed` that checks if the provided URL belongs to a list of allowed domains. This mitigates the SSRF vulnerability by ensuring that only requests to trusted domains are permitted. The use of a regular expression to extract the domain from the URL and a simple check against a list of allowed domains helps prevent unauthorized access to internal services or other unintended destinations.
